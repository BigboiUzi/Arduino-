# Force-Feedback-Steering-Wheel
Force Feedback Steering Wheel Project

This steering wheel uses the Arduino Leonardo microcontroller, bts7960 motor driver, printer encoder, 24v Psu, analog potentiometers, 3 buttons, and of course, many wires. The current properties include an exponential-based damping effect and center forcing.
It currently works with Asseto Corsa using the joystick.h library. The next step is to continue adding code such that more feedback properties for example tire dirt rumble, collision effects, and speed-sensitive steering,
For the physical changes, the project will get a cover and a new steering wheel to use.
